## Initial Idea

Offer Yoga/Boxing to young women and young men in israel, starting with the arab Sector. 


Starting with villages of Judeida-Maker, Kofr-yasif and Majd El Kuroom, a program will be developed that will offer Yoga, Meditation and Boxing to young women and men, ages 10+. 

## The program

15 minute starting meditation

30 minutes Yoga

30 minute Boxing

15 minute ending meditation

90 minutes in total for each Unit. (36 monthly hours)

offered 6 times a week to young individuals, with a focus on young women ages 10+, and hoping to expand into offering this to both genders.


## Motivation

To offer young people and especially young women a place to gather and develop their physical and mental lives. I have been hearing a lot about young females getting murdered. I think this is a topic many feels they wish they could do something about but feel powerless to approach. I recently became an uncle to a beautiful baby girl, and I wish she grows in a an environment that will empower her.

My hopes are to expand the program to have it cater to both young women and men.

So we're starting with where the need is greatest, and hoping to grow from there.

## Things needed

1. Yoga and Boxing Instructors

2. Yoga Equipment

3. Sports Hall or room large enough to fit 30 individuals.

4. Budget for a pickup-taxi that would ferry students to and from the hall.

## Finances

Due to economic ignorance, im guessing here so this would definitely change
